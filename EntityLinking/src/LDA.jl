# LDA
#   Get a list of different annotation candidates (entities with position)
#   Compute the probability of seeing the query for all topics: P(q | t) for all t
#   Score all annotation candidates by topical overlap: \sum_t \log P(c | t) + \log P(q | t)
#     Note: We know P(c | t) from our topic modeling predictions of wikipedia pages
